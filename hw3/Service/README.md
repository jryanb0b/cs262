# This repository contains the upgraded Monopoly data service used in Homework 3.

## Answers to the Questions:

 * a. Active URLs:
   * https://cs262-monopoly.herokuapp.com/playerScore
   * https://cs262-monopoly.herokuapp.com/players
   * https://cs262-monopoly.herokuapp.com/games


* b. The /playerScore URL can only be used to implement nullipotent actions. The /players and /games URLs can be used to implement nullipotent and itempotent actions.

* c. This is a RESTful data service because it is based on HTTP methods to access data using GET, POST, PUT and DELETE. It is a stateless and client-server application. It separates the UI from the server system.

* d. There is impedance mismatch in our implementation.
