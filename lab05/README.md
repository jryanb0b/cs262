* worked on multi page applications, and using stack navagation to navagate through pages 

Lab Questions:
* Of what benefit was the refactoring phase of this lab?
  * It shortened the length and complexity of our App.js file, now we have multiple files which are shorter and easier to manage
* What do the export commands do?
  * it allows for the component to be used throughout the app
* This application uses stack navigation. What does the stack do here? What is the deepest this stack can get in this application?
  * stack navagation allows the user to put pages on the stack, and then go back to previous pages with the back arrow.  The deepest the stack can get in this application is only 2
