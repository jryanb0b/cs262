Retrieve all “The King”’s game scores in decreasing order.
Retrieve the name of the winner of the game played on 2006-06-28 13:20:00.
So what does that P1.ID < P2.ID clause do in the last example query?
The query that joined the Player table to itself seems rather contrived. Can you think of a realistic situation in which you’d want to join a table to itself?



Fitsum- database queries
Adam- make patient form (opens when patient is created)
Josiah- Formating (make pretty) --if time, add 'add form button to patient page'
